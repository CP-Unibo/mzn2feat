The FlatZinc features extractor fzn2feat was developed by Roberto Amadini 
(University of Bologna).

The installation guide was provided by the MiniZinc.org team and tested on a 
64-bit machine running Ubuntu 12.04.

Prerequisites
=============

+ Flex library
	sudo apt-get install flex
+ Bison library
	sudo apt-get install bison


Installation guide
==================

Unpack fzn2feat.zip by
	
	unzip fzn2feat.zip

The extractor is then unpacked in the sub-folder fzn2feat. Move into this 
sub-folder. This sub-folder already contains an executable called fzn2feat. 
If the executable won't run then you need to rebuild it by
	
	make clean

and then
	
	make

It then creates the executable. In order to extract features from a FlatZinc 
file run

	./fzn2feat <FlatZinc file> [output]

where output can be either 'csv', 'dict', or 'pp' (see mzn2feat -o).
The corresponding features vector is then printed to stdout as specified by 
the optional output parameter (if not specified, the default value is 'csv').


Have fun!
