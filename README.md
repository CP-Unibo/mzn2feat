mzn2feat 0.1 - BETA VERSION
===========================

This is the original version of the mzn2feat feature extractor, mainly developed 
by Roberto Amadini (University of Bologna / Lab. Focus INRIA). 
Jacopo Mauro (University of Bologna / Lab. Focus INRIA) developed the compiler 
xcsp2mzn. Note that this version is more a collection of scripts rather than a 
standalone tool. It was designed for internal use only, it is not portable at 
all without user intervention. It implements the feature extractor of [1, 2] 
and it is part of the code available at: www.cs.unibo.it/~amadini/sac_2014.zip
