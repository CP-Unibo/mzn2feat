The XCSP converter to MiniZinc was developed by Jacopo Mauro (University of 
Bologna / Lab. Focus INRIA).

The installation guide was provided by the MiniZinc.org team and tested on a 
64-bit machine running Ubuntu 12.04.

Prerequisites
=============

+ GNOME XML library (libxml2-dev) 
	sudo apt-get install libxml++2.6-dev


Installation guide
==================

Unpack xcsp2mzn.zip by
	
	unzip xcsp2mzn.zip

The XCSP converter is then unpacked in the sub-folder xcsp2mzn. Move into this 
sub-folder. This sub-folder already contains an executable called xcsp2mzn. 
If the executable won't run then you need to rebuild it by
	
	make clean

and then
	
	make

It then creates the executable. In order to convert XCSP file run

	./xcsp2mzn <XCSP file>

The MiniZinc model is then printed to stdout.

Have fun!
